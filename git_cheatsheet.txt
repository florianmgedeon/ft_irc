🚀 Git Branch Workflow Cheat Sheet


📌 **Create a New Branch**
git checkout -b feature/my-feature


#### 🔄 **Switch Branches**
git checkout dev                 # switch to dev
git checkout feature/my-feature # switch to feature branch


#### 🔃 **Merge Feature into Dev**
_(from `dev` branch, pull changes from feature branch)_

git checkout dev
git pull origin dev         # get latest dev
git merge feature/my-feature
git push origin dev


#### 🔁 **Update Feature with Latest Dev**
_(from `feature/my-feature` branch)_

git checkout feature/my-feature
git pull origin dev         


#### 🧹 **Delete Branch**
git push origin --delete feature/my-feature




### ✅ Do This BEFORE You Push Changes To Your Feature Branch:

#### 1. You’re in your feature branch:
git checkout feature/my-feature

#### 2. You want to get the latest `dev` updates:
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/dev

👉 This makes sure your work is on **top of the latest `dev` branch** — which helps avoid conflicts later.

#### ✅ Then if you've **never pushed this feature branch before**:
git push -u origin feature/my-feature

#### ✅ Or if you've **already pushed before**, and now you rebased:
git push --force
